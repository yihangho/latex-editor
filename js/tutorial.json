From what we can see now, the math symbol appears in between other text outside the delimiter - it can be said that the math symbol is shown <em>inline</em> with other text, hence, it is called inline mode.

		"instruction":"Nice. As you can see, although the syntax for sigma notation appears in between other text, it is shown on its own line and is centered. This is how displayed mode shows math formula. Also take note that the delimiter for displayed mode is \\[ \\] while the delimiter for inline mode is \\( \\).<br>You have now reached the end of the tutorial. The operating model of Scribble is almost the same as what you have seen here, except you can specify a (optional) title and have to save when you're ready. Feel free to experiment with other symbols using inline mode or displayed mode before you go. Have fun!"
